# Nestjs_CloudFit
 Project is in Nest. js, which is a scalable and efficient server-side Node. js framework built with TypeScript. Nest. js was created to provide a structural design pattern to the Node.  We have also used PostgreSQL in this, an open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
